# Scrabble Word Check

The app allows the user to determine if a word is valid in the game Scrabble. If the submitted word is valid, the app will also display its base value in the game.

Additionally, a Discord bot with similar functionality runs in a separate thread.

Please check [this repository](https://github.com/fidel-techprep/scrabble-api) for the API code.
